## Introduction

OMINEX is a project designed for new learners to learn how to integrate and analyse multi-omics datasets. The project will provide a step-by-step tutorial for learners to navigate. **Python** is the main programming language used in this project. With the JupyterNotebook, users can practice to improve their programming skills and understand how to integrate and analyse multi-omics datasets for cancer subtyping and biomarker identification.

[Chapter 1 Data Loading and Preprocessing](https://github.com/WanbingZeng/OMINEX/blob/main/Chapeter%201%20Data%20Loading%20and%20Preprocessing.ipynb) introduces the Pandas🐼 library. It demonstrates how to read datasets, handle missing values, and merge multiple datasets

[Chapter 2 Integration with NMF](https://github.com/WanbingZeng/OMINEX/blob/main/Chapter%202%20Integration%20with%20NMF.ipynb) demonstrates how to use NMF🦅 for dimensionality reduction, including a detailed explanation of NMF, the detailed usage of the NMF function from the sklearn package, and the implementation of NMF assumptions.

[Chapter 3 MOFA+](£MOFA+) which is developing😺 😸 😹 😻 😼 😽 🙀 😿 😾

## Features

- **Multi-omics Data Integration**: integrate data from genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and other omics layers.
- **Dimension Reduction**: Reduce the dimentions using NMF and MOFA+
- **Interactive Features**: Generate and interact with principle components, volcano plots, heatmaps, and dendrograms.
- **Statistical Analysis**: NMF implementaion, z-score statistical tests
- **User-friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface with step-by-step instructions and comprehensive tutorials.

## Installation
