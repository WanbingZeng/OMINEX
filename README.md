## Introduction

OMINEX is a project designed for new learners to learn how to integrate and analyse multi-omics datasets. The project will provide a step-by-step tutorial for learners to navigate. **Python** is the main programming language used in this project. With the JupyterNotebook, users can practice to improve their programming skills and understand how to integrate and analyse multi-omics datasets for cancer subtyping and biomarker identification.

## Features

- **Multi-omics Data Integration**: Seamlessly integrate data from genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and other omics layers.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Generate and interact with PCA plots, volcano plots, heatmaps, and dendrograms.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Perform differential expression analysis, correlation analysis, and other statistical tests.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface with step-by-step instructions and comprehensive documentation.
