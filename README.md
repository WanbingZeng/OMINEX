## Introduction

OMINEX is a project designed for new learners to learn how to integrate and analyse multi-omics datasets. The project will provide a step-by-step tutorial for learners to navigate. **Python** is the main programming language used in this project. With the JupyterNotebook, users can practice to improve their programming skills and understand how to integrate and analyse multi-omics datasets for cancer subtyping and biomarker identification.

## Features

- **Multi-omics Data Integration**: integrate data from genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and other omics layers.
- **Dimension reduction**: Reduce the dimentions using NMF and MOFA
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Generate and interact with principle components, volcano plots, heatmaps, and dendrograms.
- **Statistical Analysis**: z-score statistical tests and NMF implementaion
- **User-friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface with step-by-step instructions and comprehensive documentation.

## Installation

To install OMINEX, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
